# Stringendo - a string parsing library

String parsing functionalites for generating plotnames, filenames and path. Used by most of my other packages, including [CodeAndRoll2](https://github.com/vertesy/CodeAndRoll2) and [ggExpress](https://github.com/vertesy/ggExpress). 
Many functionalities were part of the formerly used [CodeAndRoll (v1)](https://github.com/vertesy/CodeAndRoll).

## Installation

Install directly from **GitHub** via **devtools** with one R command:

```R
# install.packages("devtools"); # If you don't have it.
require("devtools")
devtools::install_github(repo = "vertesy/Stringendo")
```

...then simply load the package:

```R
require("Stringendo")
```

Alternatively, you simply source it from the web. 
*This way function help will not work, and you will have no local copy of the code on your hard drive.*

```R
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vertesy/Stringendo/main/R/Stringendo.R")
```

### Troubleshooting

*If you encounter a **bug**, something doesn't work or unclear, please let me know by raising an issue on [Stringendo ](https://github.com/vertesy/Stringendo/issues) â€“ Please check if it has been asked.*
